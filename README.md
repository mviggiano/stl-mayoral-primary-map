# stl-mayoral-primary-map
Playing around with results of the March 7th, 2017 Democratic Mayoral Primary in St. Louis.

This is my first time playing around with Heroku and Leaflet.js. It's my first time touching Node.js in a while as well, so this may be a bit messy as I build it up! Mostly so far this is cannibalized public code and examples from relevant documentation, reformatted and revamped to fit my needs here (then again, what code really isn't?).

I've made some additions to this file to track candidate vote percentage by ward as well - this data is available at https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/board-election-commissioners/documents/election-results/upload/Mar2017PrimaryFinalUnofficial28Wards.pdf.
